# Game of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## How it works
The Game of Life is a simple simulation governed by a few rules. Despite the simplicity of this universe, it has potential for fascinating emergent behaviour. The rules are as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## How to use

When you start the app, the cells will spawn randomly around the screen and life will unfold.

* Press **spacebar** to freeze/unfreeze time. While time is frozen you can **click** around the screen to spawn new cells.
* You can load some popular configurations by clicking **"Patterns"** in the app menu:
